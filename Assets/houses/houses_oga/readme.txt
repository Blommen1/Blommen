Collection of high-quality modern family house 3D models suitable
for games, architectural visualizations etc.

There are 6 models. Each one uses a base (diffuse) texture (with
"diffuse" uv map) - one of 3 variants of the texture can be used.
That makes for 18 unique houses. There is also an ambient occlusion
texture for each model that can be used (with "ao" uv map). There are also
baked versions which consist of a single model with a single texture
(baked version of the diffuse texture) - these don't look as good but are
simpler to use.
